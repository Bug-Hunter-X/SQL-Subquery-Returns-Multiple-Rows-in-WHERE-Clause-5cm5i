This repository demonstrates a common SQL error involving a subquery in the WHERE clause that returns multiple rows. The original query attempts to compare a single column value with multiple values from the subquery without using the appropriate set operator. This leads to a syntax error or inaccurate results. The solution provides the correct approach using the 'IN' operator, ensuring that the comparison is performed correctly against all returned rows from the subquery.
