The corrected SQL query uses the `IN` operator to handle the multiple rows returned by the subquery. This ensures that the comparison is performed correctly.  The `IN` operator checks if the value from the outer query exists within the set of values returned by the subquery.  Alternatively, `EXISTS` could be used for better performance in many cases.

Original (incorrect) query (example):
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE location = 'London');
```

Corrected query (using IN):
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id IN (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE location = 'London');
```
Corrected Query (using EXISTS):
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM departments WHERE location = 'London' AND departments.department_id = employees.department_id);
```
